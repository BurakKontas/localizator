# Localizator

Localizator is a project aimed at making multilingual content management more structured and maintainable for applications.

The main goal of the project is to provide a centralized approach for managing texts, labels, and user-facing content across different languages. By doing so, it aims to simplify adding new languages, updating existing translations, and keeping localization logic organized as projects grow.

⚠️ **This project is currently under active development.**  
Its structure, features, and usage may change over time.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Establish a common localization approach for multilingual applications
